\resheading{About}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Passionate programmer since 2003 (when I was only 11, using Pascal and GW BASIC on an e-dictionary)
\item Seasoned engineer who loves large scale distributed systems, from architecture to construction to operations.
\item Results deliverer with strong sense of ownership. Skilled in project planning and project status communication with the management team. Able to break down complex and ambiguous problems into concrete and tangible pieces, and have them properly delegated if needed.
\item Fast learner that can pick up any programming languages within hours, understand complex solution/architecture within days, and start making meaningful contributions within weeks in every team ever worked with.

    \begin{itemize}
        \resitem{AWS Step Functions is a serverless workflow orchestrator that makes it easy to connect multiple AWS services into business-critical workflow applications, and run reliably without you having to write code. }
        \resitem{Built \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/cw-logs.html}{CloudWatch Log Integration} for Step Functions customers to gain insight on their execution history. Can support log throughput of 50k events/s on a single host with total throughput scales linearly with fleet size. }
        \resitem{Built \href{https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/08/aws-step-function-adds-support-for-nested-workflows/}{Nested Workflow} that allows customers to start a workflow from within a workflow. Exponential growth in adoption since release, and has supported more than 5 billion nested workflow executions to date. }
        \resitem{Built \href{https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/}{PrivateLink} support for Amazon Managed Workflow for Apache Airflow (\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/index.html}{MWAA}) that allows enterprise customers to connect with the service endpoints without exposing traffic to the Internet. Fully automated infra provisioning that supports 0-click region build, which greatly reduces both maintenance cost and time-to-deliver. Idea shared via internal broadcast channel, and has been adopted by at least 5 other AWS service teams. }
